# r/NFRealMusic Discord Bot
the r/nfrealmusic discord, at the time of writing, has 7 public bots. i aim to change this.

will i succeed? i dunno.

will i try? hell yeah.

# prerequisites #

if you'd like to self host this bot (y'know you can invite it, right?) then you'll need to do the following 

* install mariadb & create a database & a user with all perms on that database
* get relevant API keys
* update config_example.json and rename it to config.json
* npm install for the required packages in package-lock.json
* ask yourself why you're doing this, and run node bot.js
